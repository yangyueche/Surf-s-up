# Surfs-Up Discord Bot

Surfs-Up is a Discord bot crafted with passion for surfers. Leveraging Discord.js, TypeScript, and Heroku, it helps surfers access daily weather, wind, and tide information, along with real-time wave conditions. Automated web crawling collects all necessary details and sends it to the specific discord channels corresponding to different locations.
