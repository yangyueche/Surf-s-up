# Discord Bot made for surfers

As a surfer, we check weather, wind, and tide everyday, and browse through different chat groups to see what's the wave condition of the day.

So I wrote a discord bot which is scheduled everyday to web-crawl all the information we need, and send it to different channels according to the location everyday.
